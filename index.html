                    My research interests include Healthcare Operations Management, Sustainability Operations Management, and Big Data Analytics. Below are some of my ongoing projects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Healthcare Big Data Analytics: Integrated patient choice behavior data (e.g., healthcare decisions, satisfaction ratings) and physician working schedules to analyze the impact of emotional communication on patient decision-making, identifying key emotional factors and their mechanisms.</li>
                    <li>Sustainability Operations Management: Collaborated with schools and enterprises in impoverished areas and designed the supply chain contracts for poverty alleviation.</li>
                    <li>Big Data Analytic: Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on doctor-patient communication texts, identifying emotional tendencies (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) in dialogues.</li>
