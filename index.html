                    My research interests include Healthcare Operations Management and Sustainability Operations Management. Below are some of my ongoing projects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Big Data Analytics</strong>: Integrated patient choice behavior data (e.g., healthcare decisions, satisfaction ratings) and physician working schedules to analyze the impact of emotional communication on patient decision-making, identifying key emotional factors and their mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability Operations Management</strong>: Collaborated with schools and enterprises in impoverished areas and designed the supply chain contracts for poverty alleviation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Big Data Analytic</strong>: Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on doctor-patient communication texts, identifying emotional tendencies (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) in dialogues.</li>
